# EEG-based Auditory Attention Detection via Frequency and Channel Neural Attention
This repository contains the python scripts developed as a part of the work presented in the paper "EEG-based Auditory Attention Detection via Frequency and Channel Neural Attention"

## Getting Started

## Model

A schematic diagram of the proposed CNN classifier of five components with frequency and channel neural attention (CNN-FC): (A) input multichannel EEG signals, and speech envelopes as the auditory stimulus references; (B) filter bank for EEG signals; (C1) 3D feature extraction of multi-channel EEG signals, (C2), frequency attention module, and (C3) channel attention module; (D), envelope extraction for speech streams, and (E), a convolutional neural network. The CNN-FC model is trained to detect the attended speaker, either speaker I or II, from the EEG signals. Note: speech streams of speaker I and II are denoted in red and green, while the EEG signals of the listener are denoted in blue.
